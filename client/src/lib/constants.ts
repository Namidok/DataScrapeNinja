    I'm a passionate frontend developer and UI/UX designer with over 5 years of experience
    in creating beautiful, functional, and user-centered digital experiences.
    
    Born and raised in New York City, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of
    technology and creativity. This passion led me to pursue a Computer Science degree
    at MIT, where I graduated in 2018.
