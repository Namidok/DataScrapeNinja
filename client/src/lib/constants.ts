  about: `
    I'm a passionate Python Developer with expertise in data architecture, ETL processes, and data warehousing.
    Skilled in SQL and data pipeline development, and full-stack development using technologies like Flask, Django, 
    React JS, and Node JS.
    
    I'm driven to innovate and create efficient, scalable solutions. My journey in technology has allowed me to work
    on a variety of projects from developing interactive chatbots with NLP to building robust ETL pipelines.
    
    Currently, I'm working as an Application Developer at Vavili Technologies, where I contribute to the development
    of web applications and data processing systems.
